1. Firt package in POST request is number 4. Last package is number 199, since the next non-ACK package from the server is 200 OK.

2. Client IP is 192.168.1.102 and its port is 1161.

3. Server IP is 128.119.245.12 port 80

4. SYN to initiate connection has sequence number 0. The segment has the SYN flag set to 1.

5. SYNACK sent from server has sequence number 0. The ACKnowledgement number is 1 (0 + 1 since 0 was the sequence number of previous segment and the next segment field was empty).
   The SYNACK segment has both the SYN and ACK flags set to 1

6. The segment containing the start of the POST request has sequence number 1.

7 and 8.

9. The minimum window size is 5840, sent in the SYNACK. Window size is increasing (not strictly) during the entire transmission

10. No, client never sends the same sequence number twice.

11. The server typically ACKs entire TCP segments, i.e. 1460 bytes. There are exceptions, for example no. 88 in the trace ACKs 2920 bytes.

12. Last ACK before 200 OK is for byte 164091 at time 5.455. This gives an average throughput of 30080 Bytes/s ~240 Kb/s.
    This includes TCP setup handshake and wating for the final ACK, but excluding these have little significance on the calculations.

The connections is initialized by the client sending a SYN package, the server responds with a SYNACK and then the client ACKs. Then a connection is considered established.
The estimated RTT determines the TCP timeout, i.e when a packet is considered lost. A lost packet requires a resend of some method for example go-back-n och selective repeat.
